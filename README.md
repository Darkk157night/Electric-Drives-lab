# Electric Drives Lab 

This repo contains all the software experiments conducted in the Power electronics and Drives lab during Winter 2024-2025 semester, The following list are the experiments done in the lab:
1) $3\phi$ controlled rectifier 
2) $1\phi$ controlled rectifier (Both R and RL loads)
3) DC-DC converters (Buck, Boost and Buck-Boost converters)
4) Simulation of $3\phi$ inverter (in $120^{\circ}$ and $180^{\circ}$)
5) Simulation of a Chopper fed DC motor (in Open loop and closed loop)
6) $1\phi$ AC voltage control using a TRAIC
